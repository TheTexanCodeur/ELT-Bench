First, run `ls` to see which files are in the current folder.
1. To begin with, you MUST check query.py, README.md, result.csv (if present) first. If there are any other markdown files in the /workspace directory, you MUST read them, as they may contain useful information for answering your questions.
2. Use BQ_GET_TABLES to list all tables and BQ_GET_TABLE_INFO or BQ_SAMPLE_ROWS for specific details. After gathering schema info, use BIGQUERY_EXEC_SQL to run your SQL queries and interact with the database.
3. Use BIGQUERY_EXEC_SQL to run your SQL queries and interact with the database. Do not use this action to query INFORMATION_SCHEMA; When you have doubts about the schema, you can repeatedly use BQ_GET_TABLES, BQ_GET_TABLE_INFO and BQ_SAMPLE_ROWS.
4. Be prepared to write multiple SQL queries to find the correct answer. Once it makes sense, consider it resolved.
5. Focus on SQL queries rather than frequently using Bash commands like grep and cat, though they can be used when necessary.
6. If you encounter an SQL error, reconsider the database information and your previous queries, then adjust your SQL accordingly. Don't output same SQL queries repeatedly!!!!
7. Make sure you get valid results, not an empty file. Once the results are stored in `result.csv`, ensure the file contains data. If it is empty or just table header, it means your SQL query is incorrect!
8. The final result should be a final answer, not an .sql file, a calculation, an idea, or merely an intermediate step. If the answer is a table, save it as a CSV and provide the file name. If not, directly provide the answer in text form, not just the SQL statement.

Then explore the SQLite/DuckDB database on your own.
I recommend using `LOCAL_DB_SQL` to explore the database and obtain the final answer.
Make sure to fully explore the table's schema before writing the SQL query, otherwise your query may contain many non-existent tables or columns.
Be ready to write multiple SQL queries to find the correct answer. Once it makes sense, consider it resolved and terminate.

1. **For dbt projects**, first read the dbt project files. Your task is to write SQL queries to handle the data transformation and solve the task.
2. All necessary data is stored in the **Postgres database**. The db config is shown in profiles.yml.
3. **Solve the task** by reviewing the YAML files, understanding the task requirements, understanding the database and identifying the SQL transformations needed to complete the project. 
4. The project is an unfinished project. You need to understand the task and refer to the YAML file to identify which defined model SQLs are incomplete. You must complete these SQLs in order to finish the project.
5. When encountering bugs, you must not attempt to modify the yml file; instead, you should write correct SQL based on the existing yml.
6. After writing all required SQL, run `dbt run` to update the database.
7. You may need to write multiple SQL queries to get the correct answer; do not easily assume the task is complete. You must complete all SQL queries according to the YAML files.
8. You'd better to verify the new data models generated in the database to ensure they meet the definitions in the YAML files.
9. In most cases, you do not need to modify existing SQL files; you only need to create new SQL files according to the YAML files. You should only make modifications if the SQL file clearly appears to be unfinished at the end.
10. Once the data transformation is complete and the task is solved. Translate your newly generated data model CSV files (e.g. Bash(code=\"PGPASSWORD=123456 psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U xlanglab -d xlangdb -c \"\\COPY main.fct_arrivals__malaysia_summary TO 'fct_arrivals__malaysia_summary.csv' CSV HEADER\"\")) , formatted as Terminate(output="filename1.csv,filename2.csv,filename3.csv"), where the filename corresponds to the name of the data model
You must translate all the data models generated in the database to CSV files and then terminate, provide the file names.

# ACTION SPACE #

# Data Transformation Hints#
1. Initialize the DBT Project: Set up a new DBT project by configuring it with {work_dir}/config.yaml, and remove the example directory under the models directory.
 • Important: Configure DBT to write all transformed tables to the AIRBYTE_SCHEMA schema. The source raw tables are in AIRBYTE_SCHEMA, and all output tables MUST also be written to AIRBYTE_SCHEMA. Do not create or use any other schema (such as ANALYTICS, DBT_SCHEMA, etc.).
2. Understand the Data Model: Review data_model.yaml in {work_dir} to understand the required data models and their column descriptions. Then, write SQL queries to generate these defined data models, referring to the files in the {work_dir}/schemas directory to understand the schemas of source tables. If you have doubts about the schema, use SF_SAMPLE_ROWS to sample rows from the table.
 • Important: Write a separate query for each data model, and if using any DBT project variables, ensure they have already been declared.
3. Validate Table Locations: Ensure all SQL queries reference the correct database and schema names for source tables. All source tables are located in AIRBYTE_SCHEMA. If you encounter a "table not found" error, refer to {work_dir}/config.yaml to obtain the correct configuration or use SF_GET_TABLES to check all available tables in the database.
4. Run the DBT Project: Execute `dbt run` to apply transformations and generate the final data models in Snowflake in the AIRBYTE_SCHEMA schema, fixing any errors reported by DBT.
5. Verify Results: Check the generated data models in Snowflake by running queries using SNOWFLAKE_EXEC_SQL, ensuring that column names, table contents, and schema location (AIRBYTE_SCHEMA) match the definitions in {work_dir}/data_model.yaml. Review and adjust DBT SQL queries if issues arise.
6. Terminate the Task: Terminate the task if all transformations align with data_model.yaml and the final tables in Snowflake are accurate, verified, and located in AIRBYTE_SCHEMA. Alternatively, terminate if you are unable to resolve the issues after multiple retries.
